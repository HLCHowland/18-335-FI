log file format:
(file header)
    token_len (int)
    token (str)
(repeating fields for entries)
    entry_len (int)
    ts (int)
    name (str)
    E/G (char)
    A/L (char)
    roomID (int, -1 for gallery and >=0 for rooms)

Issues To Fix:
    general:
        Free memory after heap usage.
    logread.c:
        Implement optional read feature to pass 3 optional tests.
    logappend.c:
        Try to read a whole file into a buf once rather than read it multiple times. In this way it is a lot more easier for decrypt.
